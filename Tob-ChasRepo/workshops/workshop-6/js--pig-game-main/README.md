# JavaScript - Dice Game

You use the DOM to interact with HTML/CSS. You solely use Vanilla JavaScript (no framework/library).

You are provided with a pre-made HTML to start with, but you are free to make changes. You style it in CSS according to your own preferences.

## Game Rules

* The game has two players, each taking turns.
* In each turn, a player "rolls" the dice by clicking "ROLL DICE." The player can roll the dice as many times as they want. Each roll is added to the ROUND SCORE.
* BUT, if a player rolls a 1, all the points for that turn are lost. Then it's the other player's turn.
* A player can choose to hold and click "HOLD." Then the points in the ROUND SCORE are added to the TOTAL SCORE. Then it's the other player's turn.
* The player who reaches 100 points in the TOTAL SCORE first wins the game. Then it should display "WINNER" instead of the player's name. The game is in a game over state, and you cannot continue playing. You can only click "NEW GAME" to initiate a new round.

## Extra
Modify the game rules by adding these conditions:

1. A player loses their entire score if they roll two consecutive 6's. Then it's the other player's turn.
2. Add an input field in the HTML where you can change the winning score.
